# Hand-Cricket
This is a cricket game we used to play with our hands and fingers during our school days. Here the basic rules are as follows:
a. Total number of players is two.
b. At first there will be a toss between two players to choose either balling or batting. And this toss is done by "ODD OR EVEN" game. Here, at first the 'player one' must choose either ODD or EVEN and the 'player one' and 'player two' will stand face to face (Here two hands are seen.) They will point respective number of fingers at the opponnent simultaneously. If the sum of total fingers of both the players is equal to an ODD number, the player who chose ODD will win and he can choose between Bat or ball, and if the sum is equal to the EVEN number, the player who chose EVEN won and he can choose between batting and balling.
RULES FOR RUNS AND NUMBERS( FOR ODD OR EVEN) :- 1. You play with only one hand. 2. Pointing One finger (except thumb finger) === One run 3. Pointing multiple fingers === respective runs. 3. Pointing thumb finger === six . 4. Pointing closed fist === dot ball(0)
When game starts both batsan and baller point their respective hands facing each other simultaneously FOR EACH SECOND.
The runs that are scored by batsman will be added.
If the batsman/baller doesnot press any key(point any finger), this will be considered as a dot ball for batsman and for baller- the runs of the batsman is counted. 
when both batter and baller points the same number of fingers---- Its OUT.
After Out, the baller must take the bat and OUTSCORE the run of the early batsman by atleast 1 run.
IF he is out before scoring the target, he looses.
